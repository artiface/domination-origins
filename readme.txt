## The plan

We currently use 60x60 Tiles, meaning the isometric tiles are 80x40 pixels.
I am using the 160x80 tiles that Kazuko provided, so I could theoretically zoom in at later stage

Graphics needed from Kazuko:
 - Board piece and Border for Character Portraits (not wider than a tile)
 - Buttons (around 100x80 or 100x100 or any multiple thereof)
   - Empty Button
   - Attack
   - Sprint
   - End Turn
 - Effects
   - Selected / Highlighted Tiles in some different colors
   - Bullet(s) Impact
   - Melee Weapon Swing
   - Bleeding



## Client Side

 - Init with MetaMask
 - Ask for wallet address
 - Check if we know the player's wallet
 - If not, ask for his username and store it with the wallet address
 - If so, load his username from the database
 - Select Power Level (5k, 10k, 20k)
 - Show a list of his Character and Item NFTs and their power levels
 - Allow selecting the characters
 - Allow adding items into character slots
 - Allow starting the matchmaking
 - If a match is made, ask for the battle tax, refund it if the game will end before two turns happened
 - Send commands for each turn
 - Display events generated by the server


## Server Side

 - Wait for requests
 - If a new player connects check if he is already part of a play session
 - If so, re-connect him
 - Else, start matchmaking by looking for other players that have an open session with the same power level
 - If match found: Send battle tax collection command and wait for verification
 - If so, Send initial map states to the players
