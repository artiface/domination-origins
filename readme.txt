## The plan

We will use 60x60 Tiles, meaning the isometric tiles are 120x60 pixels.
For Retina Displays, we need double that: 240x120 pixels.

So normal ground tiles will be needed in the following sizes 120x60 and 240x120.

Graphics needed from Kazuko:
 - Board piece and Border for Character Portraits (not wider than a tile)
 - Buttons (around 100x80 or 100x100 or any multiple thereof)
   - Empty Button
   - Attack
   - Sprint
   - End Turn
 - Effects
   - Selected / Highlighted Tiles in some different colors
   - Bullet(s) Impact
   - Melee Weapon Swing
   - Bleeding

## Infrastructure
 - Python Websocket Server
 - Static File Server & Reverse Proxy
   - Loadout and Battle Pages
   - Mapping the Websocket Server

## Client Side

 - Init with MetaMask
 - Ask for wallet address
 - Check if we know the player's wallet
 - If not, ask for his username and store it with the wallet address
 - If so, load his username from the database
 - Select Power Level (5k, 10k, 20k)
 - Show a list of his Character and Item NFTs and their power levels
 - Allow selecting the characters
 - Allow adding items into character slots
 - Allow starting the matchmaking
 - If a match is made, ask for the battle tax, refund it if the game will end before two turns happened
 - Send commands for each turn
 - Display events generated by the server


## Server Side

 - Wait for requests
 - If a new player connects check if he is already part of a play session
 - If so, re-connect him
 - Else, start matchmaking by looking for other players that have an open session with the same power level
 - If match found: Send battle tax collection command and wait for verification
 - If so, Send initial map states to the players

 

Ok, we should decide wether the scale of the game is fine as it is now. Because changing this after the fact could be some big trouble and would also mean re-creating most images.

I am thinking of going with 60x60px tiles on a non-retina display. The isometric tiles are then 120x60 pixels in size and for retina displays, we need double that so 240x120.

This scale would
