## The plan

All graphics need have a resolution that is divisible by the 2.

We will use 60x60 Tiles, meaning the isometric tiles are 120x60 pixels.
For Retina Displays, we need double that: 240x120 pixels.

So normal ground tiles will be needed in the following sizes 120x60 and 240x120.

I need the Hero Icons once again, with a width of 240 pixels and another version with 120 pixels width.
Can we make the color difference a bit more noticable? The red and blue border color is only on a thin part and
both look pretty dark. I'd like to have them read much easier. So it is really obvious which units are yours.
Make them brighter or change the colors? I don't know, man. You're the artist ;)

I also would need some kind of selection Marker. To show the user, that a character is currently selected and can be moved.
It can be something like an arrow over the hero or the that the hero icon border changes. Maybe you want to be creative here.
But it might be a good idea to discuss it with me before drawing it, so I can estimate how hard it would be to implement.

We also need to think about death animations. For now I just made the hero icons fall over. That has a certain ring to it already.
But what I was really thinking about, was having crosses or coffins pop up when the character died.
Like in Worms, you have gravestones that appear when your character dies. For starters we could do with just one gravestone
for every one of the three factions. They should be themed according to the faction, of course.

For the MVP state of the game I also really need that melee attack swing animation and the bullet impact animation.

I am having some mixed feeling about some of the existing token graphics because of the mixture of traditional medieval fantasy elements with science and fiction.
And it also sometimes has some completely different, divine touch with some of the weapons and chests.

I would like to know what the general theme is:
Is it fantasy, science fiction, or a mix of both? We have genetic mutations and cyberware right?
But we also have helmets, wooden chests and swords.

So maybe we could decide a bit what exactly constitutes the maximum and minimum in terms of plausibility in this setting.
Really, I was attracted to this project in the first place because it was a departure from the usual fantasy setting.
And I think the G4N9 stuff and the troop graphics don't really match with wooden chests and daggers. And I'd prefer if we leaned a bit more
in the tech, sci-fi and cyberpunk direction. But in the end that would be your decision.

With that in mind, I'd like to ask for some more high-tech looking buttons instead of the current ones. They clean round feel
doesn't fit too well with the rest. At least that's what I am feeling right now. Pleased to hear what you guys think.

Graphics needed from Kazuko:
 - Board piece and Border for Character Portraits (not wider than a tile)

 - Buttons (around 100x80 or 100x100 or any multiple thereof)
   - Empty Button
   - Attack
   - Sprint
   - End Turn
 - Effects
   - Selected / Highlighted Tiles in some different colors
   - Bullet(s) Impact
   - Melee Weapon Swing
   - Bleeding

## Infrastructure
 - Python Websocket Server
 - Static File Server & Reverse Proxy
   - Loadout and Battle Pages
   - Mapping the Websocket Server

## Client Side

 - Init with MetaMask
 - Ask for wallet address
 - Check if we know the player's wallet
 - If not, ask for his username and store it with the wallet address
 - If so, load his username from the database
 - Select Power Level (5k, 10k, 20k)
 - Show a list of his Character and Item NFTs and their power levels
 - Allow selecting the characters
 - Allow adding items into character slots
 - Allow starting the matchmaking
 - If a match is made, ask for the battle tax, refund it if the game will end before two turns happened
 - Send commands for each turn
 - Display events generated by the server


## Server Side

 - Wait for requests
 - If a new player connects check if he is already part of a play session
 - If so, re-connect him
 - Else, start matchmaking by looking for other players that have an open session with the same power level
 - If match found: Send battle tax collection command and wait for verification
 - If so, Send initial map states to the players


## Needed for Alpha Battles
 - Weapon Slots - ITEM NFTs currently CANNOT BE ITERATED OVER
 - Battle Points System
 - Test Sprinting
 - Melee and Ranged Attack Animation
 - First Three Skills
 - Hit Chance & Damage Calculations
   - Base Chance to Hit:
     - Melee: Intelligence * Level [1, 80]
     - Ranged: ((Dexterity * Level) - 5 per tile distance) [1, 80]
   - Base Damage:
     - Melee: Weapon Damage + Strength [6, 80]
     - Ranged: Weapon Damage [5, 70]
 - Battle Fee

Attribute Range: [1, 10]
Weapon Damage Range: [5, 70]

Accuracy Range: [50, 100]
Level Range: [1, 8]

## Game Modes
 - Team Deathmatch

Ok, we should decide wether the scale of the game is fine as it is now. Because changing this after the fact could be some big trouble and would also mean re-creating most images.

I am thinking of going with 60x60px tiles on a non-retina display. The isometric tiles are then 120x60 pixels in size and for retina displays, we need double that so 240x120.

This scale would
